Module 5 â€“ Puppet Workflow automation
=====================================

Workflow automation involves provisioning and configuration of multiple BIG-IP
resources. It's a wrapper module you may develope, to tie together all the
BIG-IP resource objects to achieve a high level task, such as BIG-IP
application deployment, BIG-IP device onboarding etc.

Note that wrapper module is just one way to achieve workflow automation, and
hence we make this module **Optional** for this class.
